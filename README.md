Game discription: 
Our game is a fresh take on the classic carnival game you all know and love :) Instead of the normal grid of 
moles holes, these pesky buggers can pop up anywhere on the screen! The objective has changed slightly too! Instead of racking up points-per-whack 
in a set amount of time on the same few moles, your goal is now to eliminate all ten of the pesky critters as quick as you can. Once you click a mole its 
out for the count and won't pop up again. The timer stops counting up when you whack the last mole. Choose your prefered difficulty from the beginner friendly
easy mode, up to the neck-breakingly fast hard mode and try to set the high score for each! That's all, get to whacking!
